# Portfolio Lab Assignment: Mobile-first and Responsive Design

---
# Requirements

## Your professional online presence
During the first three weeks of this course, you'll create from scratch a static "portfolio" web application that highlights your projects and interests and showcases your web development skills to potential employers or clients.

Steps to get started:
- Create a new GitHub folder or repository for this project, then create a new git branch for today's solo lab. Develop only on the new brnach until you are done with this assignment.
- This app will gain coding features that you first implement in your blog app.
- Start with a *rough* pen &amp; paper "wireframe" sketch of what you want your portfolio app to look like.
- Write and implement as many of the User Stories as you can, but always submit what you have by the due date.
- Test and do git a-c-p frequently.
- Lint:
  - Use the [.eslintrc](https://github.com/codefellows-seattle-301d7/01-mobile-first/blob/master/.eslintrc) config file to use the same linter settings as the rest of of the class.
  - Set up Atom to use this config file; alternatively, if your editor doesn't support automatic linting, install a lint package that you can run using NodeJS.
  - Get help on setting up lint if you need it; your code must pass lint before your work can be graded.

## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Minimum requirements for your portfolio:

1. As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
1. As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
1. As a developer, I need portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
1. As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
1. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
1. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.
1. As a hiring manager, I want to quickly be able to assess whether I should contact the developer to set up an interview, based on web development skills shown on the site.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals (*not required for this assignment*)
1. As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Be sure to use proper `viewport` settings.
 - Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
 - Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.
