# Class 11 (Week 3, Mon)
- Week 3 kick-off!
- URLs, Routing, &amp; page.js

A central concept in web development is the Web Request-Response Cycle (WRRC). Pay close attention to how your app creates and responds to requests. With client-side routing (using page.js) and JavaScript's "History" API, we can add a layer of abstraction on top of traditional routing. Think, "Full control of &lt;a href&gt;s".
