# Lab 12 Portfolio Assignment - REST &amp; API's

In our blog, we used RESTful routes to interact with the Github API.  It's time to take this a step further and integrate this functionality into your portfolio project.

To get started, you will need to create a controller that includes a call to the Github API. This call should grab data about your individual account, and render portions of the returned content to the page, **once the data has been loaded**.  This is fairly open ended, so use whatever data you deem fit and be sure to separate your concerns.

## Technical Requirements
- Make sure your code passes ESLint.
- Use your github token in your AJAX request, and do not include your GitHub username in the GitHub URL.
- Place all code within the proper layer of MVC abstraction and encapsulation.
- Keep your portfolio responsive as it displays API data.
- DO NOT publish your GitHub Token to any public repo.
- [+1 E.C.] Use a proxied, authenticated ajax call to GitHub's API to get data from the API.

## Submit
- Please submit in Canvas the items listed in Day 11's portfolio assignment, but the items should be for this lab, of course.
