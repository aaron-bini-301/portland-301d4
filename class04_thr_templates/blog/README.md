# Lab 02 Pair Coding: Templates &amp; Typography
Update your blog app to use Handlebars templates and a nice font(s).

## Pair Coding Set-up
For pair coding, work in one repo. Decide whose repo to use for this lab, then make sure the other person is added as a collaborator. Regardless of who's driving, the driver should work with her/his own **clone** of that repo, then push to the repo before switching roles. The new driver should "git pull" to get the latest changes into his/her laptop's workspace.

Summary:
- One repo
- Two laptops; each laptop has a clone of the same repo.
- Two people take turns driving, but each person drives her/his own laptop.

Find and work on `TODO` items in the starter code. Switch roles each time you complete one or two `TODO` items.

## TODOs: MVP
1. Include Handlebars.js in your project.
1. Convert your existing template HTML code into a Handlebars style template.
1. Update your `Article` object's `.toHTML()` method to use Handlebars.
1. You may find it useful to attach additional properties to `Article` objects before you use the template.
1. Apply at least one web font to your app, such as a Google font.
1. Stretch Goal [+1 extra credit]: The code in lines 5 thru 16 of articleView.js seem clumsy, now that you know how to use templates. Make a template in index.html that you can use to populate your &lt;option&gt; elements that are used to filter on author and categories.

## Submit
1. Create a PR to the master branch when you're done, then submit the associated URL. Both coders should submit this same URL.
2. In your PR comment, include these items:
 - Who you worked with
 - How long it took you to complete this lab
 - What technical aspect you found most enjoyable/interesting
 - What aspects (non-technical or technical) that you found most challenging
 - What aspect(s) of this lab could be improved
