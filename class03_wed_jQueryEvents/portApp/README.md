# Lab 02 Portfolio &amp; jQuery Events
Create a new branch for this lab and use that branch until this lab is done, thenuse a PR to merge the new branch back into your master branch.

Continue building and improving your portfolio site. Here's how you can use jQuery event handling:

Adapt these stories as necessary to fit how you want to build your portfolio.

## User Stories: MVP
1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
   - This means your links do NOT navigate to a new page.
   - Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
   - You can use `data-` HTML attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
   - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
1. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
1. As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
1. As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
1. As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
- Use a proper git workflow. Create a branch for this lab, work on that branch, then do a pull request to master when you're done. Use good git commit comments and commit often during development.
- Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
- Add your filters to the Nav section.
- Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
- When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no `$('#content .content')` nonsense!
- Add color and icons where appropriate.

## Submit
1. Submit the URL for your final PR.
- Write a descriptive summary of your changes:
   - How long did this lab take you to complete?
   - What did you learn that you found most useful/enjoyable?
   - Reflect on the what you accomplished and briefly summarize your process, including what you found most challenging and what you learned.
