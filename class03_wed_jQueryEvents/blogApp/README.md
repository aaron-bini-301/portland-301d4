# Lab 03 Pair Coding: jQuery &amp; Events

Today we'll add a very common feature, single-page tabs, to our blog app.

We'll also give blog readers the option to filter articles by category (and maybe even author name). Filtering is done on the Model, and affects what is shown in the View.

We will use jQuery's event handling APIs instead of "plain vanilla" JS methods.

# jQuery Events in the View

Use the provided starter code as a reference to add event handling to your basic blog app.

The code has unfinished features, and your help is needed to complete it! The blog should end up looking something like [THIS](http://hijk.it/image/1C3V1S1r3H1n/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-23%20at%2012.21.45%20PM.png).

Search through the starter code for comments that contain:

`TODO: ...`

Replace the comments and any related pseudo-code with actual, working code that you develop with your coding team.

## Pair programming
Work in pairs. Take turns as "driver" and "navigator" ("Nav").

1. Analyze Starter Code<br>
This task is to help you improve your ability to analyze code, even when it contains unfamiliar features. Don't only code fearlessly, but also learn to *analyze* code fearlessly -- develop an ability to look at advanced code without feeling intimidated. This is a great goal for you to adopt: "I don't care if I don't understand new code; I've learned how to figure it out quickly!"<br>
**Both**: read through the starter code. There's a lot of new code that's dense with new features. As a team, review the code and add comments that explain the code.

Sandbox at least **four** features that neither of you is familiar/comfortable with. Be the driver for two features, and navigate the other two.<br>
**Nav**: Decide which feature to sandbox and how the sandbox app should be implemented. Each time a person finishes *navigating* a sandbox app, the Driver should issue a PR to the *navigator's* repo, then swap roles and repos.<br>

Spend about 45 minutes on this task (code review + sandboxing) to learn about unfamiliar objects and/or methods.

1. Set up Repo<br>
**Nav**: Create a new branch that continues your blog app development where the previous day's lab left off.<br>
**Driver** fork Nav's repo and clone it and make sure you switch to the new branch in your local workspace.

1. Incorporate starter code<br>
**Nav**: Navigate while **Driver** works on her/his fork. Tell Driver what parts of starter code to add to the fork and how to modify it to fit your existing app. Remember to add all `TODO` comments/pseudo-code.

1. Fix TODO's<br>
**Driver**: Use Atom's "Find in Project" feature to generate a list of all `TODO items.<br>
**Nav**: Tackle all `TODO` items. Right after coding a TODO item, **driver** should test/debug the app.<br>
**Driver**: **a-c-p** frequently during development.

1. Final PR<br>
**Driver**: When this lab is done, make a PR to Nav's repo.

## Submit
Please submit the following items:
1. Who you worked with
- How much time you spent on this lab
- URLs
  - PRs for the **sandboxes** you navigated.
  - PR for the blog app.
- What was most challenging?
- What code features did you find most useful/interesting?
